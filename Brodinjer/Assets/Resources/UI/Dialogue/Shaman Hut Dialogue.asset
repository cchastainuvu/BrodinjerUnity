  - Go to the ancient ruins and find a way to stop the magical miasma from leaking
    out of there.
  - Do that and the villagers may change their prejudices towards you.
  - There have been many who have tried, but all have failed.
  - I believe that only you have the heritage and means of accomplishing this task.
  - Head outside and I will give you something to help you along your path.
