  - Over that hill is a path that leads straight to the ruins.
  - Take this staff with you. It'll allow you to access some of that giant magic
    within you.
  - However, your magic will not be strong enough to alter objects on its own,
  - so make sure to look out for magic-imbued objects within this world.
  - For example, theres a pumpkin in the patch that is filled with that magic. You're
    welcome to practice on that.
  - Another thing before you leave.
  - Make sure to stop by the neighbors. I'm sure he has some tools that will help
    you on your journey.
