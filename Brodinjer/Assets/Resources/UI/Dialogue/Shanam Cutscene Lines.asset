  lines:
  - I see the world has not been kind to you, child.
  - You have no need to tell me why you've come...
  - You seek acceptance.
  - The folk of this village can be cruel to those they do not understand.
  - It's a shame...
  - ...That all these simple people see in you is a past that you've had no hand
    in building.
  - The time of the giants is far behind us.
  - Further than someone so young as you could remember anyway.
  - What use is blaming a poor babe for a war in which they never took part.
  - Half giant you may be. I still believe they could see something special in you,
    something noble.
  - Perhaps you could open their hearts through action.
  - 'And I may know just the thing. '
  - 'If you wish to gain their acceptance... '
  - There is one place the village folk don't dare to tread.
  - Somewhere only you could go.
